# DCE-Capstone-GDC-T4L2
DCE Capstone GDC Project from Team 4 for Level 2

## Overview
The following repo contains Code form Banking Mortgage Process.

### Customer Problem
The current process require submitting different customer requests in inside portal by Customer Relationship Specialists (based on phone conversations with different customers). The Inside Portal provides an ability to export requests for a complete day in the form of csv file. This csv file is then used as input to create customer specific Documents with relevant Terms and priviledge detailed Templates (current process involving manual steps). Once generated,  these documents require customer signature to confirm the acceptance of Terms and discussed plan. 

## System Requirement
- Github account to be a collaborator
- Ecllipse or Intellij to do development of extension of current code branch.
- Java 8 or above to execute the application
- Any Web Browser to work with Application UI.

## Guidelines - Getting Started
### Obtaining Credentials and Downloading Sample Files
Please refer to article: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/document-services/tutorials/pdfservices/gettingstartedjava.html?lang=en

### The code is still to be added as part of the repository.

Once code is added, the next step will be as:
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to release directory.


## Running of Application
### Required inputs
- The csv file with details for each customer

### Sample for csv file will be provided shortly.
### Details of Execution will be published once the code is added.

**Requirements**
For building and running the application you need:
•	JDK 1.8
•	Maven 3

**Installation**
 To install the Document Service API, upgrade the pdfservices-api-credentials.json with right client and account credentials, generated from https://developer.adobe.com/
To install the API client library to your local repository:
At first generate the JAR either by executing:
mvn package
Then manually install the following JARs:
•	swagger-java-client-1.0.0.jar
•	okhttp-2.7.5.jar
•	gson-2.8.1.jar
•	gson-fire-1.8.0.jar
or
gradle build
Then manually install the following JARs:
•	swagger-java-client-1.0.0.jar
•	okhttp-2.7.5.jar
•	gson-2.8.1.jar
•	gson-fire-1.8.0.jar

**Getting Started**
The end user needs to follow the below mentioned steps to get started with:
1.	Once the correct formated CSV is uploaded, method runDocGenProcess get called followed by relevant unique ids, as required. It basically loads the JSON format as per the tags, calculated fields or conditions into the sample document and then return the success response else failure. 

2.
        // Initial setup, create credentials instance.
        Credentials credentials = Credentials.serviceAccountCredentialsBuilder()
                .fromFile("pdfservices-api-credentials.json")
                .build();

        // Setup input data for the document merge process
        JSONObject jsonDataForMerge = new JSONObject(content);

        // Create an ExecutionContext using credentials.
        ExecutionContext executionContext = ExecutionContext.create(credentials);

        //Create a new DocumentMergeOptions instance
        DocumentMergeOptions documentMergeOptions = new DocumentMergeOptions(jsonDataForMerge, OutputFormat.PDF);

        // Create a new DocumentMergeOperation instance with the DocumentMergeOptions instance
        DocumentMergeOperation documentMergeOperation = DocumentMergeOperation.createNew(documentMergeOptions);

        // Set the operation input document template from a source file.
        FileRef documentTemplate = FileRef.createFromLocalFile("filepath");
        documentMergeOperation.setInput(com.adobe.pdfservices.operation.io.FileRef.createFromLocalFile("provide filepath to store into local",
                DocumentMergeOperation.SupportedSourceFormat.DOCX.getMediaType()));
            // Execute the operation
            FileRef result = documentMergeOperation.execute(executionContext);

            // Save the result to the specified location.
            result.saveAs("filePath+fileName"+custID+".pdf");
    

3.	Next, in order to hit the Adobe Acrobat Sign API, user need to follow the below steps in order to get started with it:
3.1	In order to use the SDK, you need to have an account with Adobe Sign. Please register for a developer account here.
3.2	 Sign in to create an application on the Adobe Sign web portal and obtain it's application id and application secret.
3.3	 Generate the OAuth access token by using the above application id and the application secret. The access token will need to be generated by using the OAuth APIs.
3.4	 Use the generated OAuth access token for trying out the sample API code      given below.
3.5	In order to use the SDK, you need to have an account with Adobe Sign. Please register for a developer account here.
3.6	Sign in to create an application on the Adobe Sign web portal and obtain it's application id and application secret.
3.7	Generate the OAuth access token by using the above application id and the application secret. The access token will need to be generated by using the OAuth APIs.
3.8	Use the generated OAuth access token for trying out the sample API code given below.



        ApiClient apiClient= Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();

        System.out.println("*********************************");

                    //Default baseUrl to make GET /baseUris API call.
        String baseUrl = "https://api.echosign.com/";
        String endpointUrl = "/api/rest/v6";
        apiClient.setBasePath(baseUrl + endpointUrl);

        //TODO : Provide an OAuth Access Token as "Bearer : access token" in authorization
        String authorization = "Bearer Access Token";

        //Get the baseUris for the user and set it in apiClient.
        BaseUrisApi baseUrisApi = new BaseUrisApi(apiClient);
        BaseUriInfo baseUriInfo = baseUrisApi.getBaseUris(authorization);
        apiClient.setBasePath(baseUriInfo.getApiAccessPoint() + endpointUrl);

        //TODO : Provide path and name of file to be uploaded as transient document
        String filePath = "filepath"+customerId+".pdf";
        String fileName = customerId;
        File file = new File(filePath);
        String xApiUser = null;
        String xOnBehalfOfUser = null;
        String mimeType = "application/pdf";

        //Get the id of the transient document.
        TransientDocumentsApi transientDocumentsApi = new TransientDocumentsApi(apiClient);
        TransientDocumentResponse response = transientDocumentsApi.createTransientDocument(authorization, file, xApiUser, xOnBehalfOfUser, fileName, mimeType);
        String transientDocumentId = response.getTransientDocumentId();
        System.out.println("************* Trans Doc ID : " +transientDocumentId);

        //prepare request body for agreement creation.
        AgreementCreationInfo agreementInfo=new AgreementCreationInfo();
        agreementInfo.setName("Name");
        agreementInfo.setSignatureType(AgreementCreationInfo.SignatureTypeEnum.ESIGN);
        agreementInfo.setState(AgreementCreationInfo.StateEnum.IN_PROCESS);

        FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo();
        fileInfo.setTransientDocumentId(transientDocumentId);
        agreementInfo.addFileInfosItem(fileInfo);

        ParticipantSetInfo participantSetInfo = new ParticipantSetInfo();
        ParticipantSetMemberInfo participantSetMemberInfo = new ParticipantSetMemberInfo();

        //TODO : Provide email of recipient to whom agreement will be sent
        participantSetMemberInfo.setEmail(email);
        participantSetInfo.addMemberInfosItem(participantSetMemberInfo);
        participantSetInfo.setOrder(1);
        participantSetInfo.setRole(ParticipantSetInfo.RoleEnum.SIGNER);
        agreementInfo.addParticipantSetsInfoItem(participantSetInfo);

        //Create agreement using the transient document.
        AgreementsApi agreementsApi = new AgreementsApi(apiClient);
        AgreementCreationResponse agreementCreationResponse = agreementsApi.createAgreement(authorization, agreementInfo, xApiUser, xOnBehalfOfUser);
        id = agreementCreationResponse.getId();
        System.out.println("********************* Agreement ID " +id); 

**Recommendation**
- It's recommended to create an instance of ApiClient per thread and per user (with baseUris fetched for user) in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.

**Running the application locally**
- There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the adobe-sign-main\src\main\java\com\hr\docsigning\ DocsigningApplication class from your IDE.


**Steps to run**
1.	Build the project using mvn clean install
2.	Run using mvn spring-boot:run
3.	The web application is accessible via localhost:8080


## Power Automate Flow
This Power Automate flow will use the Adobe Extract API service to check if the document is digitally/Electronically signed. 

Further, the Acrobat Adobe Sign Form Data API will check for specific fields. Based upon that respective documents will be sent to respective departments of the bank for further process. 

Flow Process: 
1. Trigger this flow using the Adobe Sign trigger: whenever a document is signed. 
2. Fetch the signed PDF document. 
3. Fetch the CSV for the signed document. 
4. Used some composed functions to convert the CSV in the above step into a JSON file. 
5. Parse that JSON to define the same in conditions. 
6. Use Extract API to fetch the JSON for a document. 
7. Parse the JSON for the above step. 
8. Apply conditions from the JSON received above and send them to respective departments of the bank for further process. 

NOTE: Because this is only being used for one type of template, if you use your document, the flow might fail while parsing the JSON step. You will need to fetch the output before the Parse JSON step and add it under the edit mode of Parse JSON to make it work. 

Also, the conditions have certain specific fields related to our template. You might need to change them in order to make the flow work according to your needs.
